# eutectic_mixtures

single_components.csv contains the molecule formula and 5-6 features of each molecule. The 5 that all molecules have are molecular_weight, complexity, rotatable_bond_count, heavy_atom_count, and topological_area. Additionally a few molecules have the feature xlogp.

eutectic_complilation.csv contains pairs of molecules (molA and molB) and their eutectic mixture proportion (xe, recorded as a value from 0 to 100) and their eutectic melting point (Te, Kelvin)
